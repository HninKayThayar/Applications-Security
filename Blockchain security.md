# Blockchain security and the underlying concept
Blockchain technology relies heavily on P2P networks. there would be no current development of blockchain. The blockchain has a decentralized application theory, so it has strict security requirements for the P2P process.

# What is P2P?
```
P2P ( peer-to-peer ) network is also called peer-to-peer network, or peer-to-peer network. This is an Internet system where there is no central server and information is exchanged entirely by user groups. Each user of the P2P network is a client and also has the function of a server. Before P2P technology, all our network applications were implemented using C/S or B/S architecture. However, in the previous C/S architecture applications, the client software sent a request to the server, and the server then made a request to the client. Respond. In this case, if there are more clients, the pressure on the server will increase. However, each computer implemented by P2P technology is both a client and a server, and their functions are equal. For computers installed with P2P software (such as Thunder, QQ, etc.) to join a common P2P network, data transmission and communication can be directly carried out between nodes in the network.
